### Background
I started this as a side project back in October 2019. It's my first app and was a basis for exploring Android. There are many notes apps out there, but they're all hideous, glitchy, low quality or all 3 at the same time. Well, Notally is none of these things. It's extremely light, minimalistic and elegant. There are minimal dependencies and lines of code. (All without compromising on readability)

### Features
* Auto save
* Dark mode
* Material design
* Create lists to stay on track
* Add labels to your notes for quick organisation
* Archive notes to keep them around, but out of your way
* Export notes as plain text, HTML or PDF files with formatting
* Create rich text notes with support for bold, italics, mono space and strike-through
