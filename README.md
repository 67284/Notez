### Background
I started this as a side project back in October 2019. Although there many notes apps out there, they're all hideous, glitchy, low quality or all 3 at the same time.

Maybe the developer views developing a beautiful user interface as the realm of _lowly_ designers. Maybe he just doesn't care.

Well, Notally is none of these things. It's extremely light, minimalistic and elegant. There are minimal dependencies and lines of code. (All without compromising on readability)

### Features
* Auto save
* Dark mode
* Material design
* Create lists to stay on track
